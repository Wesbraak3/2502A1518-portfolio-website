Always curious, always learning especially where cloud tech and innovation meet.
Outside of work, I enjoy side projects, gaming, and getting outdoors.

export const Profile = `
I have been active for three years at a consultancy firm specializing in supporting companies with
complex technical installations. During this period, my focus was on developing and implementing
the Asset Health Monitor. This monitor serves as a valuable tool for determining effective
maintenance schedules for complex installations.
My expertise extends to the technological aspects involved in such innovative solutions. In
particular, I have delved into various components of the Azure cloud platform over the past few
years. Additionally, I have gained extensive experience in data extraction using protocols such as
MQTT, HTTP(S), and OPC (UA, DA). It is crucial for me to visualize this raw data and convert it into
actionable insights for management, technical services, quality control, and operators. I achieve this
by creating powerful and user-friendly Power BI dashboards.
My dedication lies in continuously striving for innovation and delivering effective solutions that
enhance operational efficiency. I always look forward to further developing and applying my
knowledge and experience in new challenging projects.
